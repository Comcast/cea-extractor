[17:34:32 -> 18:15:32]         My name's Ralph,        
[17:34:32 -> 18:15:32]         and I'm a bad guy.      
[18:56:33 -> 20:23:27]  Let's see. I'm nine feet tall. 
[18:56:33 -> 20:23:27] I weigh 643 pounds.             
[20:24:08 -> 20:47:46]         Got a little bit        
[20:24:08 -> 20:47:46]         of a temper on me.      
[20:48:28 -> 21:11:25]     Hey, you moved my stump!    
[21:20:27 -> 21:53:07]         (GROWLING)              
[21:53:49 -> 22:25:47]      RALPH: My passion bubbles  
[21:53:49 -> 22:25:47]      very near the surface,     
[22:26:29 -> 22:48:44]      I guess, not gonna lie.    
[23:23:29 -> 23:51:17]       Anyhoo, what else? Uh...  
[24:21:53 -> 25:11:14]  I'm a wrecker. I wreck things. 
[24:21:53 -> 25:11:14] Professionally.                 
[25:11:56 -> 25:39:44]   I'm going to wreck it!        
[25:40:26 -> 26:21:26]     I'm very good at what I do. 
[25:40:26 -> 26:21:26]     Probably the best I know.   
[26:22:08 -> 26:46:28]                 (YELLING)       
[26:47:10 -> 27:33:44]      The thing is, fixing       
[26:47:10 -> 27:33:44]     is the name of the game.    
[27:34:26 -> 28:06:24]          Literally,             
[27:34:26 -> 28:06:24]          Fix-It Felix, Jr.      
[28:07:06 -> 28:38:23]           NICELANDERS:          
[28:07:06 -> 28:38:23]           Fix it, Felix!        
[28:39:05 -> 29:00:38]           I can fix it!         
[29:01:19 -> 29:31:13]    RALPH: So, yeah, naturally,  
[29:31:55 -> 30:15:00]   the guy with the name         
[29:31:55 -> 30:15:00] Fix-It Felix is the good guy.   
[30:15:00 -> 30:51:51]          He's nice enough       
[30:15:00 -> 30:51:51]         as good guys go.        
[30:52:33 -> 31:25:55]         Definitely fixes        
[30:52:33 -> 31:25:55]         stuff really well.      
[31:26:36 -> 32:12:29]         But, uh, if you've      
[31:26:36 -> 32:12:29]         got a magic hammer      
[32:13:11 -> 32:41:41]         from your father,       
[32:42:23 -> 33:10:11]        how hard can it be?      
[33:10:53 -> 34:05:06]  If he was a regular contractor 
[33:10:53 -> 34:05:06] carpenter guy,                  
[34:05:48 -> 34:41:56]          I guarantee you        
[34:05:48 -> 34:41:56]         would not be able       
[34:42:38 -> 35:02:48]        to fix the damage        
[34:42:38 -> 35:02:48]     that I do as quickly.       
[35:45:54 -> 36:39:25]    And when Felix does          
[35:45:54 -> 36:39:25] a good job, he gets a medal.    
[36:40:07 -> 37:28:05]     But are there medals for    
[36:40:07 -> 37:28:05]     wrecking stuff really well? 
[37:28:46 -> 38:02:08]       To that I say, "Ha!"      
[38:02:50 -> 38:32:44]          (GROWLS LOUDLY)        
[38:32:44 -> 39:10:16]      And, no, there aren't.     
[39:10:58 -> 39:26:57]    (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)   
[40:03:47 -> 40:37:51]         Thirty years I've       
[40:03:47 -> 40:37:51]         been doing this         
[40:37:51 -> 41:25:07]    and I've seen a lot of other 
[40:37:51 -> 41:25:07] games come and go.              
[41:25:49 -> 42:12:23]  Kind of sad. I think about all 
[41:25:49 -> 42:12:23] those guys from Asteroids.      
[42:13:05 -> 42:58:58]      Boom! Gone.Centipede?      
[42:59:40 -> 43:39:59]       Who knows where           
[42:59:40 -> 43:39:59]     that guy is, you know?      
[43:40:40 -> 44:14:02]      Look, a steady arcade gig  
[43:40:40 -> 44:14:02]     is nothing to sneeze at.    
[44:14:44 -> 44:27:57]          I'm very lucky.        
[45:02:42 -> 45:40:56]            It's just,           
[45:02:42 -> 45:40:56]         I got to say,           
[45:40:56 -> 46:23:20]      it becomes kind of hard    
[45:40:56 -> 46:23:20]     to love your job            
[46:24:02 -> 46:51:09]       when no one seems to      
[46:24:02 -> 46:51:09]     like you for doing it.      
[48:02:44 -> 48:40:58]       All clear!                
[48:02:44 -> 48:40:58]       The arcade is closed!     
[48:41:40 -> 49:15:02]         Shoryuken!              
[49:15:44 -> 50:19:41]  Whoo! What a day!              
[49:15:44 -> 50:19:41]  You want to head               
[49:15:44 -> 50:19:41]  to Tappers, Ken?               
[50:20:23 -> 50:35:40]        If you're buying, buddy. 
[51:47:58 -> 52:00:29]          FELIX:                 
[51:47:58 -> 52:00:29]          Quitting time!         
[55:30:25 -> 56:05:10]       RALPH: I don't know.      
[56:05:52 -> 56:28:48]         Maybe I wouldn't be     
[56:05:52 -> 56:28:48]         feeling this way        
[56:29:30 -> 56:52:26]        if things were           
[56:29:30 -> 56:52:26]     different after work.       
[57:11:54 -> 57:41:06]       But it is what it is.     
[57:41:48 -> 58:02:39]             Good job, everyone! 
[58:03:20 -> 58:31:09]      RALPH:                     
[58:03:20 -> 58:31:09]      Felix and the Nicelanders  
[58:31:09 -> 59:07:18]    go hang out in their homes   
[59:07:18 -> 59:37:53]       which he's just fixed,    
[59:07:18 -> 59:37:53]     and everyone, you know...   
[60:23:46 -> 61:10:20]       They go to their homes,   
[60:23:46 -> 61:10:20]     I go to mine                
[61:11:02 -> 61:56:13]            which happens        
[61:11:02 -> 61:56:13]         to be a dump.           
[61:56:54 -> 62:27:30]      And when I say "a dump,"   
[62:28:11 -> 62:47:39]          I don't mean like      
[62:28:11 -> 62:47:39]         a shabby place.         
[62:48:21 -> 63:32:50]       I mean an actual dump,    
[63:33:32 -> 64:14:33]      where the garbage goes     
[64:15:14 -> 64:57:39]   and a bunch of bricks         
[64:15:14 -> 64:57:39] and smashed building parts...   
[65:21:17 -> 66:07:51]     That's what I call home.    
[66:08:33 -> 66:39:50]         I guess I can't         
[66:08:33 -> 66:39:50]         bellyache too much.
