[35:49:31 -> 36:47:54]  I've been waiting to see       
[35:49:31 -> 36:47:54]  who would redeem the chip.     
[36:48:28 -> 37:46:51]  You made such a bold entrance  
[36:48:28 -> 37:46:51]  into our little drama.         
[37:47:25 -> 38:20:47]           Did I over-complicate 
[37:47:25 -> 38:20:47]           the plot?             
[38:42:28 -> 39:26:57]  Who doesn't appreciate         
[38:42:28 -> 39:26:57]  the occasional twist, Mr...?   
[39:37:31 -> 39:58:06]                     Bond.       
[39:58:39 -> 40:18:40]                   James Bond.   
[40:35:55 -> 41:02:36]          Severine.              
[41:03:10 -> 42:13:14]  So, Mr. Bond, shall            
[41:03:10 -> 42:13:14]  we discuss your next           
[41:03:10 -> 42:13:14]  performance over that drink?   
[42:24:55 -> 42:47:09]            I'd like that.       
[43:34:59 -> 44:09:28]               Will your friends 
[43:34:59 -> 44:09:28]               be joining us?    
[44:40:36 -> 45:24:32]     That, I'm afraid,           
[44:40:36 -> 45:24:32]     is inevitable.              
[46:19:02 -> 46:39:37]          EVE: She's pretty.     
[46:40:10 -> 47:01:18]                  Now, now.      
[47:01:51 -> 47:46:54]       If you like               
[47:01:51 -> 47:46:54]       that sort of thing.       
[47:47:27 -> 48:14:42]  (WHISPERING)                   
[47:47:27 -> 48:14:42]  I'll keep you posted.          
[48:15:16 -> 48:30:50]           (CLINKS)
